Tools Used:
-HTML5: Semantic markup and structure.
-CSS: External, internal, and inline styling for layouts, colors, print, and responsiveness.

-Code editor: Visual Studio Code (recommended)
-Browser developer tools for testing and debugging(Web Chrome).

Challenges Faced and Solutions
-HTML Syntax Issues: Initially,placing a link from youtube directly didnot work and the solution i got was to embedd the video from online.
-Form Validations: Implementing validations and user-friendly error messages required testing various input formats. Added detailed feedback and prevented form submission unless validations pass.The solution was I researching regular expressions for validating email and phone number formats.
-Responsive Layouts: Achieving consistent column layouts across devices was challenging .Solution is that I utilized CSS Grid for the Projects page to create a responsive 3-column layout that adapts to different screen sizes.For the About page, I used Flexbox to create a 2-column layout that adjusts based on the viewport width.
-Theme Toggle State Persistence: Managing multiple toggle buttons and persisting theme state across pages was then solved by creating a function to set the theme based on user selection and stored the preference in localStorage. On page load, I checked localStorage for the saved theme and applied it, ensuring consistency across all pages. and also added event listeners to all theme toggle buttons to allow users to switch themes easily.
